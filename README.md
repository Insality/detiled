# Detiled

**Detiled** - is a Defold library that allows you to export tilesets and maps from [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) editor to [Decore](https://github.com/Insality/decore) entities and world collections.

## Features

- **Export Tilesets** - Export tilesets from Tiled as Decore entities collection
- **Export Map** - Export map from Tiled as Decore world collection
- **Custom Properties** - Support various custom properties for tilesets and map


### [Dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/)

Open your `game.project` file and add the following line to the dependencies field under the project section:

**[Decore](https://github.com/Insality/decore)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/decore/archive/refs/tags/1.zip
```

**[Detiled](https://github.com/Insality/detiled/archive/refs/tags/1.zip)**

After that, select `Project ‚ñ∏ Fetch Libraries` to update [library dependencies]((https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies)).
